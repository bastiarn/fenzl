# fenzl - Freut Euch Nicht Zu Laut

A little game [@agelmarc](https://www.github.com/agelmarc) and me wrote in a haste for a party

Using a GM1356 Sound Level Meter (connected via USB), the game constantly monitors the loudness of the room.
At the beginning of each round, a random volume level (dBa) and a range surrounding it is automatically selected. If the players don't manage to stay within that given volume range for a set amount of time, they collectively loose a life.

Once all lives have been lost, the entire group gets punished.

There's no real way to win this game. We just kept it running in the background while eating, talking, playing other games, etc., trying to maintain the volume ranges at all times and having fun with the penalties that ensued.
Must have been fun for our neighbors to hear us collectively yell and scream for a minute straight, followed by complete silence for a minute directly after...
